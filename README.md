# TriviaGame
Made a trivia game dealing mostly with goofy "conspiracy theories" and a 
few extra random questions to round it out to 10 possible questions. Its not 
the prettiest piece of work in the world, but I feel like I am starting to get
the hang of piecing together the css, html, javaScript and jQuery.
